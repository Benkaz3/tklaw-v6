Litigation involves formal court proceedings where disputes are adjudicated by a judge or jury, while dispute resolution encompasses alternative methods like mediation and arbitration, which aim to settle disputes outside of court. Law firms in this area represent clients in a wide range of conflicts, including commercial disputes, employment disagreements, intellectual property cases, contract breaches, and more. They guide clients through every stage of the legal process, from pre-litigation negotiations to trial and appeals, while helping them explore more efficient and cost-effective alternatives to courtroom battles.",
